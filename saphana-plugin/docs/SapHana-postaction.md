# SAP HANA Query Post-run Action


Description
-----------
Runs a SAP HANA query at the end of the pipeline run.

Use Case
--------
The action is used whenever you need to run a query at the end of a pipeline run.
For example, you may have a pipeline that imports data from a database table to
hdfs files. At the end of the run, you may want to run a query that deletes the data
that was read from the table.
